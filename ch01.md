# Chapter 01: What Ever Are We Doing? 第一章：我们在做什么？

## Introductions 介绍

Hi there! I'm Professor Franklin Frisby. Pleased to make your acquaintance. We'll be spending some time together, as I'm supposed to teach you a bit about functional programming. But enough about me, what about you? I'm hoping that you're at least a bit familiar with the JavaScript language, have a teensy bit of Object-Oriented experience, and fancy yourself a working class programmer. You don't need to have a PhD in Entomology, you just need to know how to find and kill some bugs.

看这里！我是富兰克林·弗里斯比。很高兴认识你。我们将一起度过一些时间，我应该教你一点关于函数式编程的知识。我很满足了，那你呢？我希望你至少对 Javascript 语言有点熟悉，有一点面向对象（Object-Oriented）的经验，
并把自己想象成一个业务程序员。只需要发现并解决错误。

I won't assume that you have any previous functional programming knowledge, because we both know what happens when you assume. I will, however, expect you to have run into some of the unfavorable situations that arise when working with mutable state, unrestricted side effects, and unprincipled design. Now that we've been properly introduced, let's get on with it.

假设你以前没有任何函数式编程的经验。想必你在工作中使用可变数据，无限制的副作用，无原则设计时遇到不好解决的问题。现在已经介绍好了，就让我们开始吧。

The purpose of this chapter is to give you a feel for what we're after when we write functional programs. In order to be able to understand the following chapters, we must have some idea about what makes a program *functional*. Otherwise we'll find ourselves scribbling aimlessly, avoiding objects at all costs - a clumsy endeavor indeed. We need a clear bullseye to hurl our code at, some celestial compass for when the waters get rough.

本章的目的是，给你一种使用了函数是编程之后的感觉。目的是为了能够理解下面章节，我们必须对程序的*功能*有一些了解。

Now, there are some general programming principles - various acronymic credos that guide us through the dark tunnels of any application: DRY (don't repeat yourself), YAGNI (ya ain't gonna need it), loose coupling high cohesion, the principle of least surprise, single responsibility, and so on.

现在已经有了一些编程的通用原则。DRY（不要重复做，don't repeat yourself），高内聚低耦合（loose coupling high cohesion），YAGNI （你不会用到它的，ya ain't gonna need it），最小意外原则（Principle of least surprise），单一责任（single responsibility）等等。

I won't belabor you by listing each and every guideline I've heard throughout the years... The point of the matter is that they hold up in a functional setting, although they're merely tangential to our ultimate goal. What I'd like you to get a feel for now, before we get any further, is our intention when we poke and prod at the keyboard; our functional Xanadu.

## A Brief Encounter 偶遇

Let's start with a touch of insanity. Here is a seagull application. When flocks conjoin they become a larger flock, and when they breed, they increase by the number of seagulls with whom they're breeding. Now, this is not intended to be good Object-Oriented code, mind you, it is here to highlight the perils of our modern, assignment based approach. Behold:

让我们从一个看起来非常蠢的例子开始。这是一个海鸥的程序。当几群聚在一起时他们变成更大一群，而且当他们繁衍时，增加的数量就是他们繁衍出的个数。这并不是面向对象编程的实践，请注意，这里强调了变量赋值的危险性。

```js
class Flock {
  constructor(n) {
    this.seagulls = n;
  }

  conjoin(other) {
    this.seagulls += other.seagulls;
    return this;
  }

  breed(other) {
    this.seagulls = this.seagulls * other.seagulls;
    return this;
  }
}

const flockA = new Flock(4);
const flockB = new Flock(2);
const flockC = new Flock(0);
const result = flockA
  .conjoin(flockC)
  .breed(flockB)
  .conjoin(flockA.breed(flockB))
  .seagulls;
// 32
```

Who on earth would craft such a ghastly abomination? It is unreasonably difficult to keep track of the mutating internal state. And, good heavens, the answer is even incorrect! It should have been `16`, but `flockA` wound up permanently altered in the process. Poor `flockA`. This is anarchy in the I.T.! This is wild animal arithmetic!

世上谁精心制造了如此可恨的东西？跟踪操作过程中值的改变是多么困难。而且连答案都不对，我们预期的是 `16`,但 `flockA` 在执行的过程中被永久性的改变了。这是数据的混乱。

If you don't understand this program, it's okay, neither do I. The point to remember here is that state and mutable values are hard to follow, even in such a small example.

如果你不明白这个程序，没关系。需要记住的一点是，状态和可变值很难被追踪，哪怕在这个小小的例子中。

Let's try again, this time using a more functional approach:

让我们再试一次，这次用更实用的方法。

```js
const conjoin = (flockX, flockY) => flockX + flockY;
const breed = (flockX, flockY) => flockX * flockY;

const flockA = 4;
const flockB = 2;
const flockC = 0;
const result =
    conjoin(breed(flockB, conjoin(flockA, flockC)), breed(flockA, flockB));
// 16
```

Well, this time we got the right answer. With much less code. The function nesting is a tad confusing... (we'll remedy this situation in ch5). It's better, but let's dig a little bit deeper. There are benefits to calling a spade a spade. Had we scrutinized our custom functions more closely, we would have discovered that we're just working with simple addition (`conjoin`) and multiplication (`breed`).

这次对了，用了很少的代码。函数嵌套有点乱（我们将在第五章解决）。这样写非常又好处，不吹不黑。再仔细看一下我们的自定义函数，会发现只是简单的做了加法`conjoin`和乘法`breed`.

There's really nothing special at all about these two functions other than their names. Let's rename our custom functions to `multiply` and `add` in order to reveal their true identities.

除了名字，这两个函数完全没有什么特别的。让我们改成 `multiply` 和 `add` 这两个名字，用以表现它们固有的特征。


```js
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;

const flockA = 4;
const flockB = 2;
const flockC = 0;
const result =
    add(multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockC)), multiply(flockA, flockB));
// 16
```
And with that, we gain the knowledge of the ancients:

我们可以学以致用：

```js
// associative 结合律
add(add(x, y), z) === add(x, add(y, z));

// commutative 交换律
add(x, y) === add(y, x);

// identity 0加一个数是一个数的本身
add(x, 0) === x;

// distributive 分配律
multiply(x, add(y,z)) === add(multiply(x, y), multiply(x, z));
```

Ah yes, those old faithful mathematical properties should come in handy. Don't worry if you didn't know them right off the top of your head. For a lot of us, it's been a while since we learned about these laws of arithmetic. Let's see if we can use these properties to simplify our little seagull program.

背过的数学公式终于能用上了。如果这些公式不能脱口而出，别担心。因为距离我们学这些公式已经有一段时间了。下面使用这些属性简化海鸥程序。

```js
// Original line 初始行
add(multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockC)), multiply(flockA, flockB));

// Apply the identity property to remove the extra add  使用0加一个数是这个数的本身这个性质，移除加0 这一步
// (add(flockA, flockC) == flockA)
add(multiply(flockB, flockA), multiply(flockA, flockB));

// Apply distributive property to achieve our result 使用分配律的逆运算
multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockA));
```

Brilliant! We didn't have to write a lick of custom code other than our calling function. We include `add` and `multiply` definitions here for completeness, but there is really no need to write them - we surely have an `add` and `multiply` provided by some existing library.

太好了！除了调用函数，我们不必写任何自定义的代码。我们完全实现了`add` 和 `multiply`两个方法，但真的没必要写他们，已经有了一些库提供了这两个方法。

You may be thinking "how very strawman of you to put such a mathy example up front". Or "real programs are not this simple and cannot be reasoned about in such a way." I've chosen this example because most of us already know about addition and multiplication, so it's easy to see how math is very useful for us here.

你可能回想，这个例子太有数学性质，真实的程序中不会这么简单，不能用同样的方式解决。选择这个例子是因为大多数人知道加法和乘法，因此，很容易看出数学对我们的重要性。

Don't despair - throughout this book, we'll sprinkle in some category theory, set theory, and lambda calculus and write real world examples that achieve the same elegant simplicity and results as our flock of seagulls example. You needn't be a mathematician either. It will feel natural and easy, just like you were using a "normal" framework or API.

不要绝望，在这本书中，我们将介绍一些范畴理论、集合论和lambda微积分，并编写一些真实的例子，这些例子与我们的海鸥群的例子一样，实现了优雅和简单。你也不必是个数学家。使用它将感觉自然和简单，就像您使用的是一个`常规`框架或api。

It may come as a surprise to hear that we can write full, everyday applications along the lines of the functional analog above. Programs that have sound properties. Programs that are terse, yet easy to reason about. Programs that don't reinvent the wheel at every turn. Lawlessness is good if you're a criminal, but in this book, we'll want to acknowledge and obey the laws of math.

听到我们可以按照上面的功能模拟来编写完整的日常应用程序，可能会感到惊讶。程序是会说话的，是简洁，且容易推理的，不需要重复造轮子。本书中，我们要承认并遵守数学定律。

We'll want to use a theory where every piece tends to fit together so politely. We'll want to represent our specific problem in terms of generic, composable bits and then exploit their properties for our own selfish benefit. It will take a bit more discipline than the "anything goes" approach of imperative programming (we'll go over the precise definition of "imperative" later in the book, but for now consider it anything other than functional programming). The payoff of working within a principled, mathematical framework will truly astound you.

我们希望去践行每一部分都能完美接合的理论，希望能以一种通用的、可组合的组件来表示我们的特定问题，然后利用这些组件的特性来解决这些问题。相比命令式（稍后本书将会介绍命令式的精确定义，暂时我们还是先把重点放在函数式上）编程的那种“某某去做某事”的方式，函数式编程将会有更多的约束，不过你会震惊于这种强约束、数学性的“框架”所带来的回报。

We've seen a flicker of our functional northern star, but there are a few concrete concepts to grasp before we can really begin our journey.

在真正开始我们的旅程之前，我们要先掌握一些具体的概念。
