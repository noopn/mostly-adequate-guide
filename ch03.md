# Chapter 03: Pure Happiness with Pure Functions
# 第 3 章: 纯函数的好处

## Oh to Be Pure Again
## 再次强调“纯”

One thing we need to get straight is the idea of a pure function.
首先需要清楚的一点是纯函数的概念

>A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any observable side effect.
纯函数是这样一种函数，相同的输入，总是返回相同的输出，而且没有任何的副作用。

Take `slice` and `splice`. They are two functions that do the exact same thing - in a vastly different way, mind you, but the same thing nonetheless. We say `slice` is *pure* because it returns the same output per input every time, guaranteed. `splice`, however, will chew up its array and spit it back out forever changed which is an observable effect.
比如 `slice` 和 `splice`。这两个函数以不同的方式做了相同的事情。我们说 `slice` 是纯净的，因为它每次相同的输入都保证返回相同的结果。而 `splice` 截取数组并返回，这是一个副作用，数组被永久性的改变了。

```js
const xs = [1,2,3,4,5];

// pure
xs.slice(0,3); // [1,2,3]

xs.slice(0,3); // [1,2,3]

xs.slice(0,3); // [1,2,3]


// impure
xs.splice(0,3); // [1,2,3]

xs.splice(0,3); // [4,5]

xs.splice(0,3); // []
```

In functional programming, we dislike unwieldy functions like `splice` that *mutate* data. This will never do as we're striving for reliable functions that return the same result every time, not functions that leave a mess in their wake like `splice`.
在函数式编程中，不想见到像 `splice` 这样的改变了数据的函数。我们追求的是那种可靠的，每次都能返回同样结果的函数，而不是像 `splice` 这样每次调用后都把数据弄得一团糟的函数，这不是我们想要的。

Let's look at another example.
来看看另一个例子。

```js
// impure
// 不纯
let minimum = 21;
const checkAge = age => age >= minimum;

// pure
// 纯
const checkAge = (age) => {
  const minimum = 21;
  return age >= minimum;
};
```

In the impure portion, `checkAge` depends on the mutable variable `minimum` to determine the result. In other words, it depends on system state which is disappointing because it increases the [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) by introducing an external environment.
在不纯的版本中，`checkAge` 以来了会影响结果的可变变量 `minimum`。换句话说，它依赖于系统状态，这是令人失望的，因为它通过引入了外部环境增加了 [认知负载]。

It might not seem like a lot in this example, but this reliance upon state is one of the largest contributors to system complexity (http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf). This `checkAge` may return different results depending on factors external to input, which not only disqualifies it from being pure, but also puts our minds through the ringer each time we're reasoning about the software.
这个例子可能还不是那么明显，但这种依赖状态是影响系统复杂度的元凶。输入值之外的因素能够左右 checkAge 的返回值，不仅让它变得不纯，而且导致每次我们思考整个软件的时候都痛苦不堪。

Its pure form, on the other hand, is completely self sufficient. We can  also make `minimum` immutable, which preserves the purity as the state will never change. To do this, we must create an object to freeze.
另一方面，使用纯函数的形式，函数就能做到自给自足。我们也可以让 `minimum` 成为一个不可变（immutable）对象，这样就能保留纯粹性，因为状态不会有变化。要实现这个效果，必须得创建一个对象，然后调用 Object.freeze 方法：

```js
const immutableState = Object.freeze({ minimum: 21 });
```

## Side Effects May Include...
## 副作用可能包括...

Let's look more at these "side effects" to improve our intuition. So what is this undoubtedly nefarious *side effect* mentioned in the definition of *pure function*? We'll be referring to *effect* as anything that occurs in our computation other than the calculation of a result.
让我们在看看这些 "副作用" 来提高我们的一种直觉。那么，我们在纯函数定义中提到的万分邪恶的*副作用*到底是什么？*作用*我们可以理解为一切除结果计算之外发生的事情。

There's nothing intrinsically bad about effects and we'll be using them all over the place in the chapters to come. It's that *side* part that bears the negative connotation. Water alone is not an inherent larvae incubator, it's the *stagnant* part that yields the swarms, and I assure you, *side* effects are a similar breeding ground in your own programs.
*作用*本身并没什么坏处，而且在本书后面的章节你随处可见它的身影。*副作用*的关键部分在于*副*。副作用中的*副*是滋生 bug 的温床。

>A *side effect* is a change of system state or *observable interaction* with the outside world that occurs during the calculation of a result.
>*副作用*是在计算结果的过程中，系统状态的一种变化，或者与外部世界进行的可观察的交互。

Side effects may include, but are not limited to
副作用可能包含，但不限于：

  * changing the file system 更改文件系统
  * inserting a record into a database 往数据库插入记录
  * making an http call 发送一个 http 请求
  * mutations 可变数据
  * printing to the screen / logging 打印/log
  * obtaining user input 获取用户输入
  * querying the DOM DOM-查询
  * accessing system state 访问系统状态

And the list goes on and on. Any interaction with the world outside of a function is a side effect, which is a fact that may prompt you to suspect the practicality of programming without them. The philosophy of functional programming postulates that side effects are a primary cause of incorrect behavior.
这个列表还可以继续写下去。概括来讲，只要是跟函数外部环境发生的交互就都是副作用——这一点可能会让你怀疑无副作用编程的可行性。函数式编程的哲学就是假定副作用是造成不正当行为的主要原因。

It is not that we're forbidden to use them, rather we want to contain them and run them in a controlled way. We'll learn how to do this when we get to functors and monads in later chapters, but for now, let's try to keep these insidious functions separate from our pure ones.
这并不是说，要禁止使用一切副作用，而是说，要让它们在可控的范围内发生。后面讲到 functor 和 monad 的时候我们会学习如何控制它们，目前还是尽量远离这些阴险的函数为好。

Side effects disqualify a function from being *pure*. And it makes sense: pure functions, by definition, must always return the same output given the same input, which is not possible to guarantee when dealing with matters outside our local function.
副作用让一个函数变得不纯是有道理的：从定义上来说，纯函数必须要能够根据相同的输入返回相同的输出；如果函数需要跟外部事物打交道，那么就无法保证这一点了。

Let's take a closer look at why we insist on the same output per input. Pop your collars, we're going to look at some 8th grade math.
我们来仔细了解下为何要坚持这种「相同输入得到相同输出」原则。注意，我们要复习一些八年级数学知识了。

> A function is a special relationship between values: 函数是不同数值之间的特殊关系
> Each of its input values gives back exactly one output value. 每一个输入值返回且只返回一个输出值。

In other words, it's just a relation between two values: the input and the output. Though each input has exactly one output, that output doesn't necessarily have to be unique per input. Below shows a diagram of a perfectly valid function from `x` to `y`;
换句话说，函数只是两种数值之间的关系：输入和输出。尽管每个输入都只会有一个输出，但不同的输入却可以有相同的输出。下图展示了一个合法的从 x 到 y 的函数关系；

<img src="images/function-sets.gif" alt="function sets" />(https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html)

To contrast, the following diagram shows a relation that is *not* a function since the input value `5` points to several outputs:
相反，下面这张图表展示的就不是一种函数关系，因为输入值 5 指向了多个输出：

<img src="images/relation-not-function.gif" alt="relation not function" />(https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html)

Functions can be described as a set of pairs with the position (input, output): `[(1,2), (3,6), (5,10)]` (It appears this function doubles its input).
函数可以描述为一个集合，这个集合里的内容是 (输入, 输出) 对：[(1,2), (3,6), (5,10)]（看起来这个函数是把输入值加倍）。

Or perhaps a table:或者一张表：
<table> <tr> <th>Input</th> <th>Output</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>6</td> </tr> </table>

Or even as a graph with `x` as the input and `y` as the output:
甚至一个以 x 为输入 y 为输出的函数曲线图：

<img src="images/fn_graph.png" width="300" height="300" alt="function graph" />

There's no need for implementation details if the input dictates the output. Since functions are simply mappings of input to output, one could simply jot down object literals and run them with `[]` instead of `()`.
如果输入直接指明了输出，那么就没有必要再实现具体的细节了。因为函数仅仅只是输入到输出的映射而已，所以简单地写一个对象就能“运行”它，使用 [] 代替 () 即可。

```js
const toLowerCase = {
  A: 'a',
  B: 'b',
  C: 'c',
  D: 'd',
  E: 'e',
  F: 'f',
};
toLowerCase['C']; // 'c'

const isPrime = {
  1: false,
  2: true,
  3: true,
  4: false,
  5: true,
  6: false,
};
isPrime[3]; // true
```

Of course, you might want to calculate instead of hand writing things out, but this illustrates a different way to think about functions. (You may be thinking "what about functions with multiple arguments?". Indeed, that presents a bit of an inconvenience when thinking in terms of mathematics. For now, we can bundle them up in an array or just think of the `arguments` object as the input. When we learn about *currying*, we'll see how we can directly model the mathematical definition of a function.)
当然了，实际情况中你可能需要进行一些计算而不是手动指定各项值；不过上例倒是表明了另外一种思考函数的方式。（你可能会想“要是函数有多个参数呢？”。的确，这种情况表明了以数学方式思考问题的一点点不便。暂时我们可以把它们打包放到数组里，或者把 arguments 对象看成是输入。等学习 curry 的概念之后，你就知道如何直接为函数在数学上的定义建模了。）

Here comes the dramatic reveal: Pure functions *are* mathematical functions and they're what functional programming is all about. Programming with these little angels can provide huge benefits. Let's look at some reasons why we're willing to go to great lengths to preserve purity.
戏剧性的是：纯函数就是数学上的函数，而且是函数式编程的全部。使用这些纯函数编程能够带来大量的好处，让我们来看一下为何要不遗余力地保留函数的纯粹性的原因。

## The Case for Purity
## 追求“纯”的理由

### Cacheable
### 可缓存性（Cacheable）

For starters, pure functions can always be cached by input. This is typically done using a technique called memoization:
首先，纯函数总能够根据输入来做缓存。实现缓存的一种典型方式是 memoize 技术：

```js
const squareNumber = memoize(x => x * x);

squareNumber(4); // 16

squareNumber(4); // 16, returns cache for input 4 从缓存中读取输入值为 4 的结果

squareNumber(5); // 25

squareNumber(5); // 25, returns cache for input 5 从缓存中读取输入值为 5 的结果
```

Here is a simplified implementation, though there are plenty of more robust versions available.
下面的代码是一个简单的实现，尽管它不太健壮。

```js
const memoize = (f) => {
  const cache = {};

  return (...args) => {
    const argStr = JSON.stringify(args);
    cache[argStr] = cache[argStr] || f(...args);
    return cache[argStr];
  };
};
```

Something to note is that you can transform some impure functions into pure ones by delaying evaluation:
值得注意的一点是，可以通过延迟执行的方式把不纯的函数转换为纯函数：

```js
const pureHttpCall = memoize((url, params) => () => $.getJSON(url, params));
```

The interesting thing here is that we don't actually make the http call - we instead return a function that will do so when called. This function is pure because it will always return the same output given the same input: the function that will make the particular http call given the `url` and `params`.
这里有趣的地方在于我们并没有真正发送 http 请求——只是返回了一个函数，当调用它的时候才会发请求。这个函数之所以有资格成为纯函数，是因为它总是会根据相同的输入返回相同的输出：给定了 url 和 params 之后，它就只会返回同一个发送 http 请求的函数。

Our `memoize` function works just fine, though it doesn't cache the results of the http call, rather it caches the generated function.
我们的 memoize 函数工作起来没有任何问题，它缓存的并不是 http 请求所返回的结果，而是生成的函数。

This is not very useful yet, but we'll soon learn some tricks that will make it so. The takeaway is that we can cache every function no matter how destructive they seem.

### Portable / Self-documenting

Pure functions are completely self contained. Everything the function needs is handed to it on a silver platter. Ponder this for a moment... How might this be beneficial? For starters, a function's dependencies are explicit and therefore easier to see and understand - no funny business going on under the hood.

```js
// impure
const signUp = (attrs) => {
  const user = saveUser(attrs);
  welcomeUser(user);
};

// pure
const signUp = (Db, Email, attrs) => () => {
  const user = saveUser(Db, attrs);
  welcomeUser(Email, user);
};
```

The example here demonstrates that the pure function must be honest about its dependencies and, as such, tell us exactly what it's up to. Just from its signature, we know that it will use a `Db`, `Email`, and `attrs` which should be telling to say the least.

We'll learn how to make functions like this pure without merely deferring evaluation, but the point should be clear that the pure form is much more informative than its sneaky impure counterpart which is up to who knows what.

Something else to notice is that we're forced to "inject" dependencies, or pass them in as arguments, which makes our app much more flexible because we've parameterized our database or mail client or what have you (don't worry, we'll see a way to make this less tedious than it sounds). Should we choose to use a different Db we need only to call our function with it. Should we find ourselves writing a new application in which we'd like to reuse this reliable function, we simply give this function whatever `Db` and `Email` we have at the time.

In a JavaScript setting, portability could mean serializing and sending functions over a socket. It could mean running all our app code in web workers. Portability is a powerful trait.

Contrary to "typical" methods and procedures in imperative programming rooted deep in their environment via state, dependencies, and available effects, pure functions can be run anywhere our hearts desire.

When was the last time you copied a method into a new app? One of my favorite quotes comes from Erlang creator, Joe Armstrong: "The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana... and the entire jungle".

### Testable

Next, we come to realize pure functions make testing much easier. We don't have to mock a "real" payment gateway or setup and assert the state of the world after each test. We simply give the function input and assert output.

In fact, we find the functional community pioneering new test tools that can blast our functions with generated input and assert that properties hold on the output. It's beyond the scope of this book, but I strongly encourage you to search for and try *Quickcheck* - a testing tool that is tailored for a purely functional environment.

### Reasonable

Many believe the biggest win when working with pure functions is *referential transparency*. A spot of code is referentially transparent when it can be substituted for its evaluated value without changing the behavior of the program.

Since pure functions don't have side effects, they can only influence the behavior of a program through their output values. Furthermore, since their output values can reliably be calculated using only their input values, pure functions will always preserve referential transparency. Let's see an example.


```js
const { Map } = require('immutable');

// Aliases: p = player, a = attacker, t = target
const jobe = Map({ name: 'Jobe', hp: 20, team: 'red' });
const michael = Map({ name: 'Michael', hp: 20, team: 'green' });
const decrementHP = p => p.set('hp', p.get('hp') - 1);
const isSameTeam = (p1, p2) => p1.get('team') === p2.get('team');
const punch = (a, t) => (isSameTeam(a, t) ? t : decrementHP(t));

punch(jobe, michael); // Map({name:'Michael', hp:19, team: 'green'})
```

`decrementHP`, `isSameTeam` and `punch` are all pure and therefore referentially transparent. We can use a technique called *equational reasoning* wherein one substitutes "equals for equals" to reason about code. It's a bit like manually evaluating the code without taking into account the quirks of programmatic evaluation. Using referential transparency, let's play with this code a bit.

First we'll inline the function `isSameTeam`.

```js
const punch = (a, t) => (a.get('team') === t.get('team') ? t : decrementHP(t));
```

Since our data is immutable, we can simply replace the teams with their actual value

```js
const punch = (a, t) => ('red' === 'green' ? t : decrementHP(t));
```

We see that it is false in this case so we can remove the entire if branch

```js
const punch = (a, t) => decrementHP(t);
```

And if we inline `decrementHP`, we see that, in this case, punch becomes a call to decrement the `hp` by 1.

```js
const punch = (a, t) => t.set('hp', t.get('hp') - 1);
```

This ability to reason about code is terrific for refactoring and understanding code in general. In fact, we used this technique to refactor our flock of seagulls program. We used equational reasoning to harness the properties of addition and multiplication. Indeed, we'll be using these techniques throughout the book.

### Parallel Code

Finally, and here's the coup de grâce, we can run any pure function in parallel since it does not need access to shared memory and it cannot, by definition, have a race condition due to some side effect.

This is very much possible in a server side js environment with threads as well as in the browser with web workers though current culture seems to avoid it due to complexity when dealing with impure functions.


## In Summary

We've seen what pure functions are and why we, as functional programmers, believe they are the cat's evening wear. From this point on, we'll strive to write all our functions in a pure way. We'll require some extra tools to help us do so, but in the meantime, we'll try to separate the impure functions from the rest of the pure code.

Writing programs with pure functions is a tad laborious without some extra tools in our belt. We have to juggle data by passing arguments all over the place, we're forbidden to use state, not to mention effects. How does one go about writing these masochistic programs? Let's acquire a new tool called curry.
